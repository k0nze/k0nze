# Hi, I'm k0nze! 👋

I'm a graduate research assistant working on latency prediction models for AI workloads executed on accelerator hardware enabling fast optimization loops for neural network architecture search (NAS) and pre-silicon hardware evaluation. 

My expertise includes:
* 5+ years of Verilog programming and FPGA synthesis ⚙️⚡
* 4+ years in Deep Neural Network applications 🤖
* 4+ years of C/C++ programming for high-performance computing and embedded devices 🖥️
* 4+ years of Python programming for scientific analysis 🐍🧪

My colleagues describe me as a detail-oriented analytical thinker with a passion for learning new things. I am a team player because I enjoy tackling challenges as a group and discussing problem solutions from different angles to learn from others and share my knowledge.

I am currently working on my PhD thesis at the embedded systems group (Prof. Bringmann) at the [University of Tübingen](https://github.com/ekut-es).
