# Hi, I'm k0nze! üëã

I work as a üéì graduate research assistant at [Unversity of T√ºbingen](https://github.com/ekut-es), and I make Youtube videos on programming, computer science, and everything in between. My main interests are performance modeling and performance prediction of embedded computer architectures, focusing on machine learning/deep learning accelerators.

On my Youtube channel, I'm sharing my knowledge of programming and computer science with you and help you to improve your skills, so make sure to get subscribed.
